# Digital Twin AI Agents on Hedera

This project involves the development of AI agents that act as digital twins for humans, automating a wide range of tasks such as interacting with external services (phone calls, emails, and messages), conducting online job searches, scheduling appointments and recording them into calendars, finding deals and discounts, negotiating better rates, and more. 
These agents serve as personal assistants, taking over mundane chores that are not enjoyable, saving valuable time and money for users. They monitor ongoing tasks and ensure optimal outcomes, all while securely logging actions on Hedera Hashgraph.
